# Joystick-MouseMode
Built mainly for the ALU but should work on other devices

Joystick mouse mode which allows you to use the ALU P1 and P2 controls to act like a mouse. Please be aware that this ALU OTG MM may throw a false positive on your virus scanner due to using MPRESS on the executable to make the executable smaller. This is the latest version (this will also check if running as admin, if not it will run as admin to be able to click on some other windows such as onscreenkeyboard).

A = Left Click 
B = Right Click
C = Middle Click (scrolling)

P1 A + Menu = Enable / Disable P1 MM
P2 A + Menu = Enable / Disable P2 MM

Rewind + P1 = Close App
Z + Menu = Open / Close x360ce 4.10 

v1.4
- If the app isn't run in Admin mode it will automatically reload into admin mode
